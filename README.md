## Contribution guidelines
If you do decide to contribute to my repository - to begin with, **Thanks**! You will need to ensure that your submissions follow the guidelines below in order for me to be able to accept you PR.

### Keep your code valid!
Any code submissions via PRs are checked for validity using the Github actions [Hound](https://github.com/marketplace/hound) and [PSScriptAnalyzer checks](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/psscriptanalyzer-checks). Together they ensure that there are no validation errors in both Markdown and PowerShell content in any new content. The latter also ensures that best practices recommended by the [PowerShell Team](https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/PowerShellTeam) are also being followed.
